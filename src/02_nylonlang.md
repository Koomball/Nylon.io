# Nylon Programming Language
The Nylon Programming Language takes inspiration from Bot Designer For Discords bdscript2 and the storage language yaml turning coding into a easily readable and translatable step by step process.

> # PART A
> ## How Does Nylon Work?
> The Nylon Programming Language (NPL) is a language that takes inspiration from Bot Designer For Discord`s (BDFD) BDscript2. But expands it to be able to be modified and used to program anything you can imagine.
> # PART A.1
> ## Threading a language.
> First when making a project in the Nylon Design Engine you have to pick a language to thread Nylon through, this dictates how the language will work and its functions letting you intergrate it with already existing projects in said language.
> ### Nylon Native
> Nylon Native is the raw Nylon based programming language the Nylom Design Engine uses. This is the most documenented and up to date thread within the Nylon Design Language and it is highly reccomended to recode your projects in Nylon Native and not to thread another language. (unless using html)
> ### HTML / CSS
> Nylon also can thread with HTML & CSS allowing for extremely easy website development.
> Example tray in html:
> ```html
> <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=3>===================================================================================</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td colspan=3><${\color{green}BDFD \ \ WIKIS}$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>${\color{blue}BDFD}$</p></td>
            <td><code>Easy (1/5)</code></td>
            <td> <code>Published: 13/05/24</code> <br> <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Koomball/BDFD-Author-Only-Interactions/tree/main"> Author Only Interactions. </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
> ```
> In Nylon.html:
> ```
> $table[$thead[$tr[$th[3;>===================================================================================]]]
$tbody[
$tr[
  $td[3;${\color{green}BDFD \ \ WIKIS}$]]
$tr[
  $td[1;${\color{blue}BDFD}$]
  $td[1;$code[Easy (1/5)]]
  $td[1;$code[Published: 13/05/24]$nline
  $hyperlink[Author Only Interactions;https://github.com/Koomball/BDFD-Author-Only-Interactions/tree/main]]
